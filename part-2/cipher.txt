For my cipher, the alphabet split between vowels and consonants (including y). 
Vowels are reassigned to numbers in reverse order (AEIOUY = 654321). 
Consonants are shifted up two letters (FGHJK = DEFHI)
Letters cycle through so AB = YZ

My cypher would rewrite "I love cryptography!" as "4 J3T5 AP1NR3EP6NF1!". 
Running "4 J3T5 AP1NR3EP6NF1!" into the cipher function does not in fact decipher the code,
an inverse code would need to be written to decipher it (and that would take just as long or longer)
to write.
